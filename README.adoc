= dotfiles

Personal configuration files. I also include other things, such as sample
LaTeX files and includable AsciiDoc file with attributes. I am tracking them
to for convenience, and sharing them in case anyone sees any of their contents
as useful.

== Stow

In searching for a premade solution to manage configuration files, I came
across mentions of https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow]. Check out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs[this cool YouTube video] explaining
the basics of how it works. See also the
https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/[GNU Stow manual].

The `.stow-local-ignore` file is used to prevent symlinks from being created
for certain files. For example, the `tex` directory does not actually exist
in my home folder, so I don't want a `/tex` symlink pointing to
`~/dotfiles/tex`.
